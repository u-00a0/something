1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
Warning.

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,260
You are being attacked by an autonomous drone.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,620
How many?

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,675
Warning.

5
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,080
We don't know.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,580
We're still figuring that out.

7
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,715
Warning.

8
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,430
You are running out of time.

9
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,805
Listen closely.

10
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:20,215
We will show you what to do to increase your chances for survival.

11
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,700
For as long as we reasonably can.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,250
Don't worry.

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,100
Yet.

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,620
That's just the surveillance drone.

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,255
It goes ahead and scouts an area to locate targets and assess defences.

16
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:37,560
It's technically harmless.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,640
But what follows it isn't.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,920
And it's closing in on your location.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,300
Get to cover immediately.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,550
Good thing that door was strong enough.

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,380
You bought yourself time.

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,970
I will take this chance to explain.

23
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,010
Listen carefully.

24
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,850
What you just encountered was a pair of modified FPV drones.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,510
FPV or first-person view drones are cheap,

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,720
lightweight and extremely fast.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,865
Reaching speeds of up to 140 kilometers an hour,

28
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,720
they are agile enough to strike a variety of targets.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,255
Including static targets and moving vehicles.

30
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,990
The motors give off a characteristic screech that sounds like this.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,860
Typically piloted by drone operators using VR goggles,

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,625
they hunt and respond based on a real-time video feed.

33
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:39,680
FPV drones are often deployed in a hunter-killer pair.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,220
Like a sniper team, one drone is responsible for surveillance,

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,710
the other for pulling the trigger.

36
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,560
Surviving that first strike is commendable.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,545
Good job.

38
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:52,100
But your hiding spot is compromised.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,760
Other drones are incoming.

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
You must move to a safe spot.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,490
Now.

42
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,125
Your only chance is getting to the nearest city.

43
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,115
Somewhere that has a military presence.

44
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,135
Jammers.

45
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,650
Anti-aircraft guns.

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,640
Missiles.

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Bunkers.

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,030
But you need to survive long enough to get there.

49
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,590
Grab some gear, whatever you have on hand.

50
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,330
Ski goggles, a helmet and a thick leather jacket.

51
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,040
To shield you from debris or shrapnel from drone impacts.

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,690
A small powder-based fire extinguisher can at least cover sensors.

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,335
Or create a smokescreen.

54
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:26,175
Done?

55
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,080
Go.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,170
Get into a vehicle and drive as fast as possible.

57
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,950
Wait.

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,460
Is that a chicken coop?

59
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,425
Good.

60
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,850
Destroy it and place it on top of that car.

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,580
If you can't stay concealed,

62
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,980
staying protected is the next best thing.

63
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,330
Get in.

64
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,200
Damn.

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,110
That was quick.

66
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,500
The drones above you are trailing a thin strand.

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,415
Up to 30 kilometers worth of fiber optic line.

68
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,670
They must know that you are heading for the city.

69
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,520
These drones don't rely on radio signals.

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,765
They are hardwired to the operator.

71
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,950
Impossible to jam.

72
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,240
But they are louder, slower,

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,035
and the wire can get tangled.

74
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,190
Head for the forest.

75
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,770
That's one.

76
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,425
And that's two.

77
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:09,215
Ouch.

78
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,265
Are you alive?

79
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,160
Good.

80
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,330
You added a layer of protection that one drone could not get through.

81
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,300
The car and chicken coop cover have bought you some time.

82
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,130
For now.

83
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,710
Warning.

84
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,295
More drones are coming.

85
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,830
The closer you get to the city,

86
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,135
the more sophisticated the systems will be.

87
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,375
They are optimized to avoid human error.

88
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,770
Drive as fast and far as you can.

89
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,890
We'll take this time to explain.

90
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:43,250
In 2013, MIT engineering students launched the Perdix system.

91
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,170
A small, low-cost UAV that can be deployed in large numbers.

92
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,450
They launched 103 Perdix drones from three FA-18 Super Hornets.

93
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,210
The drones operate with a distributed brain,

94
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,330
allowing them to change conditions without centralized control.

95
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,060
The Perdix drones share data,

96
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,290
have no single leader,

97
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,510
and reconfigure when drones are added or removed.

98
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,775
By 2015, the Office of Naval Research revealed a low-cost UAV swarming technology,

99
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:34,135
also known as LOCUST.

100
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:37,500
A tube-based launcher for releasing small,

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,530
unmanned autonomous vehicles in rapid succession.

102
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,240
The LOCUST program was the precursor for drone swarms.

103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,010
In theory, hundreds of small autonomous UAVs could cost less than a single tactical

104
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,105
aircraft, while also being more effective and robust.

105
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,080
Unmanned systems were force multipliers.

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,960
One agent could, in theory,

107
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,965
control significantly more assets in battlespace.

108
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:12,070
A swarm could also coordinate.

109
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,870
They operate most commonly in waves.

110
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,305
The surveillance wave gathers information across large areas.

111
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:26,995
This involves mapping the environment,

112
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:30,015
identifying and location potential targets,

113
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:31,825
detecting enemy defense,

114
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:34,615
and providing persistent information for commanders.

115
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:38,630
To do this, the surveillance wave uses coordinated search patterns.

116
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,590
These include, but are not limited to,

117
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,815
random walks, creeping lines,

118
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:48,250
expanding squares, grid-based,

119
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,930
and two-step search and survey.

120
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,330
By flying at layered altitudes,

121
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,970
they ensure coverage in both vertical and horizontal space.

122
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,430
For persistent surveillance,

123
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,665
they may loiter in the surrounding perimeters,

124
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,565
with drones cycling in and out in pulses.

125
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,705
Once surveillance is gathered,

126
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:10,950
the second wave starts.

127
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,335
The key objective of this wave is to destroy and suppress the enemy's defense.

128
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,280
Once defenses are overwhelmed,

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,740
the last wave begins.

130
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,775
The strike wave.

131
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:23,330
Warning.

132
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,390
Speed up.

133
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,370
You're so close.

134
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,690
That looks painful.

135
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,365
Can you run?

136
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,890
You're almost there.

137
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,400
Wow.

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,945
I really thought you were a goner.

139
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,980
There must be a jammer close by.

140
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,750
They emit a powerful radio frequency signal that severs critical inter-drone communication

141
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,190
links.

142
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,090
Overwhelming their GPS navigation across a wide area.

143
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,470
Some advanced systems even use high-power microwaves...

144
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,790
to disrupt the electronic systems of multiple drones simultaneously.

145
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,285
Time to get to that bunker.

146
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:04,810
Quickly.

147
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,990
Do you hear that?

148
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,710
That low rumble is the AVIC Zhou Tian.

149
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,300
This 10-ton Chinese mothership is designed to carry and deploy drone swarms...

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,900
across vast distances.

151
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
With a 25-metre wingspan...

152
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,860
it operates at altitudes of 15,000

153
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,705
metres...

154
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:29,940
far beyond the range of most air defences.

155
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,640
Its 7,000-kilometre range means it can launch from deep within enemy territory...

156
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
and still reach its target.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,940
Each Zhou Tian carries up to 100 smaller drones...

158
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,915
in internal payload bays.

159
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,400
When multiple motherships coordinate...

160
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,260
they can cover thousands of square kilometres simultaneously.

161
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,320
The sub-drones share information instantly...

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,680
creating a connected network that adapts to changing conditions.

163
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,225
What makes this system particularly effective is scale.

164
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,500
Individual countermeasures become irrelevant...

165
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,215
when facing hundreds of coordinated drones.

166
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,580
Standard survival tactics no longer apply.

167
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,020
These narrow streets are providing good cover.

168
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,000
It's too late to get to the bunker...

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,035
but you have time to hunker down in one of these buildings.

170
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:16,940
Get in!

171
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,620
Quick!

172
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,707
Drone swarms can achieve mass destruction...

173
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:26,350
through the accumulation of many small-scale attacks.

174
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,220
They are a fundamental shift in weapons technology.

175
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,220
Modern wars are described as unmanned hellscapes...

176
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,500
where an offensive swarm campaign...

177
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,480
would meet a counter-swarm of drones.

178
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,260
At this point, no place is safer than any other.

179
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,300
Any door you barricade is a door that can be destroyed.

180
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,460
Your survivability depends on one thing...

181
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,510
Who is sending the attack?

182
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,140
When a human controls a drone...

183
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,875
there are inherent limitations.

184
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,880
Reaction time averages 200 to 300 milliseconds...

185
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,705
for complex decisions.

186
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:09,915
Fatigue degrades performance after extended operations.

187
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:13,565
Moral hesitation can delay or prevent engagement.

188
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,720
A human pilot might miss a target...

189
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,700
due to stress or poor visibility...

190
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,760
might choose not to fire on ambiguous targets...

191
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,635
might make tactical errors under pressure.

192
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:26,140
These human weaknesses can become...

193
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,640
your survival advantages.

194
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,160
You can exploit predictable behavior patterns.

195
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Confuse operators with decoys...

196
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,900
or unexpected movements.

197
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,250
Force them into situations...

198
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,220
where human judgment becomes a liability.

199
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,040
But artificial intelligence operates...

200
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,940
by different rules.

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,320
An AI can process visual data in microseconds.

202
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,955
They don't experience fatigue,

203
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,380
fear or moral conflict.

204
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,470
Executing mission parameters with mathematical precision.

205
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,500
If you are designated as a target...

206
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,060
it will pursue you with unwavering focus.

207
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,935
20 to 60 euros.

208
00:09:58,935 --> 00:09:59,500
And this whole concept of evolution is true...

209
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,520
is the realtà...

210
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,540
efficiency of human intelligence...
