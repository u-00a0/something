1
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:04,213
At 9:27 am

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:04,213
话说那主体104年3月24号

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,166
on the 24th of March 2015,

4
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,166
的一个早晨，9点27分

5
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:12,001
a plane got in contact with the Marseilles enroute control center.

6
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:12,001
一架航班联络了马赛航路管制中心

7
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,305
It was an Airbus A320-211

8
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,305
那是架空客A320-211，

9
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,168
operated by Germanwings

10
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,168
由德国之翼航空运营

11
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,320
headed from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.

12
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,320
正从巴塞罗那飞往杜塞尔多夫

13
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,129
Everything seemed normal.

14
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,129
一切似乎如常

15
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:31,437
The captain read back the air traffic controller's clearance at 9:30, allowing him to fly to an enroute waypoint.

16
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:31,437
9点30分, 机长复诵了空管允许他飞往某个航路点的放行指令,

17
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:34,140
Only a few minutes later, something was off.

18
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:34,140
然而几分钟后，事情不对劲了起来

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,444
The control center in Marseilles

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,444
马赛的管制中心

21
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,649
saw that the altitude for the aircraft

22
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,649
发现飞机的高度

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,180
was around thirty thousand feet,

24
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,180
在三万英尺左右徘徊

25
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:46,640
almost two thousand feet lower than the original cruise altitude.

26
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:46,640
比原定的巡航高度低了差不多两千英尺

27
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,288
and declining.

28
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,288
且其高度仍在持续下降

29
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,046
Marseilles contacted the plane

30
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,046
马赛空管联系了航班

31
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,818
and asked what altitude the plane was cleared for,

32
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,818
并询问飞机获准飞行的高度

33
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:56,520
but they received no response at all

34
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:56,520
但他们没有收到回复

35
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,069
over the next 30 seconds,

36
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,069
之后的三十秒内

37
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,400
Marseilles tried to contact the flight crew two more times.

38
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,400
空管又试了两次

39
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,392
No answer.

40
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,392
还是没有答复

41
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:09,381
At 9:34 the control center tried a different frequency,

42
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:09,381
34分，空管再次尝试用不同频率联系

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,007
but again no response.

44
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,007
机组仍然没有答复

45
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,360
From 9:35 until 9:39

46
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,360
从35分到39分

47
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:21,789
the Marseilles control center tried to contact the flight crew multiple times over different frequencies.

48
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,789
马赛空管坚持多次用不同频率联系机组

49
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,411
An air traffic controller from the French air defense system

50
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,411
另一架飞机 以及一位法国防空系统的管制员

51
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,320
also tried as well as another aircraft

52
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,320
也尝试联系德翼9525

53
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,892
but each time

54
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,892
然而

55
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,680
no response from Germanwings flight 9525

56
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,680
德翼9525却一直没有回复

57
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,767
At 9:40 radar contact was lost

58
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,767
9点40分, 德翼9525的雷达信号消失了

59
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,093
the French air traffic controllers triggered a distress phase

60
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,093
法国空管启动了紧急程序

61
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,654
declaring that the aircraft and its occupants

62
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,654
宣布该飞行器及其乘员

63
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:50,851
were in imminent danger and required immediate assistance

64
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:50,851
处于迫在眉睫的危机之中并需要他人立即援助

65
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:55,039
At 9:41 am flight Germanwings 9525

66
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:55,039
41分,

67
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,540
crashed into the side of a mountain in the Alps.

68
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,540
德翼9525坠毁在了阿尔卑斯山脉的一侧

69
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,476
What happened?

70
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,476
到底发生了什么？

71
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,482
The crash occurred on a remote mountain.

72
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,482
事故发生在偏远山区

73
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:07,609
Because there was no access by road,

74
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:07,609
山上没通公路

75
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,850
emergency crew had to be brought in via helicopter.

76
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,850
救援人员不得不乘直升机前往

77
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,605
The plane was completely destroyed:

78
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,605
飞机撞的粉碎

79
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:17,140
the debris field vast but the pieces of the craft small.

80
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:17,140
碎片散步的区域很大, 而碎片本身却很小

81
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,907
The cockpit voice and flight recorder were found in the same week

82
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,907
驾驶舱语音记录器和飞行数据记录仪在同一周被发现

83
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,944
although they were both severely damaged.

84
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,944
不过它们也被摔的惨烈

85
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,673
When flight investigators stitched together the data

86
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,673
当调查员整合完毕数据

87
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:29,275
a story of intentional action formed.

88
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:29,275


89
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,151
The plane was hijacked,

90
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,151
飞机被劫持了

91
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,479
but not by terrorists.

92
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,479
只不过不是被恐怖分子劫持的

93
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,340
Let's go back.

94
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,340
我们来回顾一下

95
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:44,618
After the aircraft leveled off at its cruise altitude,

96
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:44,618
9点半, 飞机离开巡航高度后

97
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:48,875
the captain left the cockpit to go to the bathroom at 9:30

98
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:48,875
机长离开驾驶舱去了厕所

99
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,945
While he was in the bathroom,

100
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,945
他在厕所里时

101
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:53,183
the plane was almost immediately set

102
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:53,183
飞机立刻被设置了

103
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,453
for a different altitude in the cockpit

104
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,453
一个不同的高度

105
00:02:56,327 --> 00:03:01,920
At 9:34, the captain came back and requested
access, but he got none.

106
00:02:56,327 --> 00:03:01,920
34分, 机长上完厕所回来

107
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,199
The door was locked.

108
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,199
但他被锁在了驾驶舱门外

109
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:07,226
As he stood in front of that cockpit door

110
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:07,226
站在舱门前

111
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,264
the captain began to understand.

112
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,264
机长明白了

113
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,655
The co-pilot had hijacked the plane

114
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,655
副机长劫持了这架飞机

115
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,700
and he had no way of getting in.

116
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,700
而他没法进入驾驶舱

117
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,373
After 2001,

118
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,373
911事件后

119
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:24,693
cockpits were changed in order to protect those flying the plane from potential hijackers

120
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:26,659
飞机驾驶舱被改装以防止可能的劫机发生

121
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,073
To enter the cockpit,

122
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,073
机组成员想进入驾驶舱

123
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,811
a crew member has to call the cockpit on the intercom

124
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,811
就必须按键盘上的井号

125
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,377
and press the pound key on a keypad,

126
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,377
用对讲系统呼叫驾驶舱

127
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,681
which buzzes the cockpit.

128
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,681
让驾驶舱里的人听到嗡嗡声

129
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,337
At that moment the pilot can switch the door control

130
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,337
这之后飞行员可以控制舱门

131
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,013
from norm to unlock,

132
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,013
将其切换到解锁状态

133
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,514
and the crew member can enter.

134
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,514
随后机组成员便可进门

135
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,198
The crew is also given emergency codes

136
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,198
机组也有应急密码

137
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:48,091
which they can use if there are concerns for those in the cockpit.

138
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:48,091
可在驾驶舱内人员出问题时使用

139
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,804
in that case the crew member will use the emergency code on the keypad

140
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,804
机组可以在键盘上输入应急密码

141
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:55,019
triggering a 30 second timer

142
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:55,019
30秒后,

143
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,831
and the cockpit door will open for 5 seconds

144
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,831
舱门就会打开5秒钟

145
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:02,335
however there are situations where those in the cockpit

146
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:02,335
然而, 在某种情况下

147
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,000
want to override the access by the crew

148
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,000
譬如被劫机时

149
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,029
like during a hijacking

150
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,029
驾驶舱里的人可以阻止机组成员开门

151
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:11,273
in that situation the pilots can switch the door control to lock

152
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:11,273
飞行员可以把舱门切换到锁定状态

153
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,440
overriding all emergency access.

154
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,440
阻止他人用应急密码开门

155
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,748
and it's that mechanism

156
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,748
德翼9525的副机长

157
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,200
that the co-pilot used

158
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,200
正是使用了这个机制

159
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,901
to permanently lock access to the cockpit

160
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,901
锁定了驾驶舱门

161
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,952
while the plane began to descend.

162
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,952
飞机开始下降时

163
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,733
The captain was locked out of the cockpit

164
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,733
机长被锁在了外边

165
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,200
without any control.

166
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,200
无法操控飞机

167
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,962
At 9:39 the cockpit voice recorder

168
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,962
39分时,

169
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,740
picked up violent blows on the cockpit door.

170
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,740
语音记录器录下了舱门上传来的猛烈撞击声

171
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,108
The captain had repeatedly tried breaking in to gain access

172
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,108
机长尝试破门

173
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,768
but the cockpit door was reinforced.

174
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,768
但舱门为反武装劫机而设计

175
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:45,140
Made to withstand armed hijackers

176
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:45,140
十分坚固

177
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,040
the captain stood little chance.

178
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,040
机长胜算微渺

179
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,703
In the last minutes

180
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,703
在最后的几分钟里

181
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,839
the passengers crew and Captain

182
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,839
机组与乘客

183
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,200
all knew that the plane was going down.

184
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,200
都了发现飞机正在坠毁

185
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,207
No one survived the crash.

186
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,207
机上144位乘客

187
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,126
144 passengers

188
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,126
4位乘务员

189
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,323
four cabin crew

190
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,323
机长及副机长

191
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,340
and the captain and co-pilot died.

192
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,340
无人幸存

193
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,715
Amongst the passengers was an entire school class

194
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,715
乘客中, 有一整个班的孩子

195
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:12,008
returning from a field trip to Spain.

196
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:12,008
在西班牙郊游完毕正返校

197
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,927
The captain Patrick Sondenheimer

198
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,927
机长帕特里克·桑德海默*

199
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,291
was a 34 year old father of two.

200
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,291
时年34, 膝下二儿

201
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,247
In the aftermath his wife set up a foundation in his name

202
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,247
事后, 机长的妻子以他的名义设立了一家基金会

203
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,738
intended to help children and young people handle grief and crisis.

204
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,738
来帮助儿童及年轻人应对危机与悲伤

205
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,360
He had thousands of total flight hours

206
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,360
机长有数千小时的飞行经验

207
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:30,319
and his last moments were dedicated to trying to save the plane and passengers.

208
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:30,319
直到最后一刻, 他还在力图挽救乘客与飞机

209
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,102
The co-pilot was 27 years old

210
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,102
副机长时年27

211
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:43,464
and from a young age he was passionate about flying.

212
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:43,464
从小他就热衷于飞行

213
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:47,315
His bedroom had posters of Airbus Boeing and Lufthansa

214
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:47,315
他的卧室里贴着波音、空客与汉莎航空的海报

215
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,224
and he'd become an expert glider pilot as a child.

216
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,224
他小时候就精通于滑翔机驾驶

217
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,233
He joined Lufthansa's Flight Academy straight out of school,

218
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,233
他一毕业就加入了汉莎航空的飞行学院

219
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,903
but only a few months into the program

220
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,903
但仅仅几个月后

221
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:57,822
he stopped.

222
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:57,822
他就被停飞了

223
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,145
He was suffering from a deep depressive episode

224
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,145
他正经历着一次严重的抑郁症发作

225
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,979
treated with antidepressants

226
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,979
同时在服用抗抑郁药物

227
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,966
and spent multiple months in the care of a psychiatrist.

228
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,966
并接受了长达数月的治疗

229
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,090
Eventually he received a medical recommendation

230
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,090
最终他收到了一份医疗建议

231
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,731
declaring that he was in remission.

232
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,731
宣布他已处于缓解期

233
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:14,873
After a few months

234
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:14,873
数月后

235
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:19,482
his student pilot license and fit to fly medical certificate were restored,

236
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:19,482
他的学生飞行员执照与适航医疗证明被恢复

237
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,963
but if he needed any more psychiatric treatment

238
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,963
不过如果仍需要进一步的心理治疗

239
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,084
he'd be grounded from flying.

240
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,084
他就会被停飞

241
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,877
But he continued with his training

242
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,877
但他继续进行训练

243
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,000
until he ran into a problem.

244
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,000
直到撞上南墙

245
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,546
While filling out a document required by the U.S Federal Aviation Administration

246
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,546
在填写一份由美国联邦航空管理局(FAA)要求的文件,

247
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:40,113
to fly at an Arizona based Lufthansa operated flight school

248
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:40,113
以在亚利桑那州的一家汉莎航空旗下航校飞行时

249
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,511
he said that he had never been diagnosed

250
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,511
他说他从未被诊断

251
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:43,920
with any mental disorders.

252
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:43,920
患有任何精神疾病

253
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,287
This was a lie

254
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,287
这是个谎言

255
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,896
and he got caught.

256
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,896
而他被揭穿了

257
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,284
Lying on an FAA application can lead to a jail offense

258
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,284
在FAA申请中造假可能构成刑事犯罪

259
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,541
or the end of a flying career,

260
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,541
也可能终结他的飞行生涯

261
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,216
but the FAA gave him a second chance.

262
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,216
但FAA给了他第二次机会

263
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,680
He admitted to depression

264
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,680
他承认他患有抑郁症

265
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,543
and was accepted to go to Arizona.

266
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,543


267
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,452
In 2013 he joined Germanwings

268
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,452


269
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,800
a low-budget Airline owned by Lufthansa.

270
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,800


271
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,074
And a year later his depression returned.

272
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,074


273
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,663
He thought he was going blind

274
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,663


275
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:19,582
visiting ophthalmologists and neurologists multiple times per week

276
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:19,582


277
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:26,208
because he was seeing stars, halos, flashes of light, streaks, and flying insects.

278
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:26,208


279
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,620
But the doctor's scans didn't find much.

280
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,620


281
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,729
He was diagnosed with hypochondriacal disorder

282
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,729


283
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,760
as well as emergent psychosis from his family doctor.

284
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,760


285
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,276
And that doctor urged him to go to a psychiatric clinic,

286
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,276


287
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:42,461
but he do no such thing.

288
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:42,461


289
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,164
Instead in January of 2015

290
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,164


291
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,109
he returned to the psychiatrist

292
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,109


293
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,540
that had helped him in the first place.

294
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,540


295
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,175
He received Psychotherapy

296
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,175


297
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,304
and went on heavy antidepressants

298
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,304


299
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,140
while continuing to work and fly.

300
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,140


301
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,999
From February to March

302
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,999


303
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,214
he received multiple sick notes from multiple doctors.

304
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,214


305
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,324
He wasn't alright and he wanted something to change.

306
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,324


307
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,861
Four days before the crash

308
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,861


309
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:12,269
he turned to his computer to understand the locking mechanism

310
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:12,269


311
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,536
on the Airbus A320 cockpit door.

312
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,536


313
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,701
On his outbound flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona

314
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,701


315
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,722
he tested the descent settings for a moment

316
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,722


317
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,000
while Sondenheimer was outside the cockpit.

318
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,000


319
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,576
On the return flight

320
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,576


321
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:28,616
he used it to bring down the plane.

322
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:28,616


323
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,635
How could this have happened?

324
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,635


325
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,222
Pilots are required to do Health screenings and annual
checkups,

326
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,222


327
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,866
but mental health is easier overlooked than physical.

328
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,866


329
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,092
Since Pilots operate under an honor system

330
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,092


331
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:44,926
they're expected to self-evaluate their health.

332
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:44,926


333
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,780
And this can be an issue.

334
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,780


335
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,818
The co-pilot was declared unfit to work by his doctor,

336
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,818


337
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:52,828
but he decided to just not tell his employer.

338
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:52,828


339
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,872
But if someone like him is a risk to Public Safety

340
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,872


341
00:08:56,872 --> 00:09:00,205
a doctor can break doctor-patient confidentiality

342
00:08:56,872 --> 00:09:00,205


343
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,680
and report him to authorities.

344
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,680


345
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,572
So why didn't at least one of the multiple doctors

346
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,572


347
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,536
who wrote multiple sick notes

348
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,536


349
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,905
and declared him unfit to fly

350
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,905


351
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:15,600
think that the co-pilot may have presented a risk for public safety?

352
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:15,600


353
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,851
Enough of a risk

354
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,851


355
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,373
that he couldn't be trusted to report himself?

356
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,373


357
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,693
We don't know.

358
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,693


359
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,693
The doctors may have believed the co-pilot was a risk to himself

360
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,693


361
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,186
but not to others.

362
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,186


363
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,709
Being depressed does not make you a killer.

364
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,709


365
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,797
Or maybe the doctors were just scared.

366
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,797


367
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:40,000
Breaking doctor-patient confidentiality does not come without risks.

368
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:40,000


369
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,020
It's even possible cultural factors could have played a role.

370
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,020


371
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,780
Privacy and data protection are valued really highly in Germany.

372
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,780


373
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,000
But trying to understand why doctor patient confidentiality wasn't broken

374
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,000


375
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,543
is a dilemma an issue best left to healthcare professionals and ethics professors.

376
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,543


377
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,053
And unfortunately we're YouTubers.

378
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,053


379
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,500
So we encourage you to read more about it in these articles.

380
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,500


381
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,277
Nonetheless when you're watching this today

382
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,277


383
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,053
it's important to understand that this type of incident

384
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,053


385
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,254
is incredibly unlikely.

386
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,254


387
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:19,410
In the aftermath the European Aviation safety agency

388
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:19,410


389
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,261
proposed multiple safety regulations.

390
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,261


391
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,996
Psychological screening for pilots increased

392
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,996


393
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:30,166
and multiple Airlines adopted a two-person in the cockpit at all-time rule

394
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:30,166


395
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,520
although Lufthansa has recently phased this out.

396
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,520


397
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,146
In 2015 Germanwings was rebranded to Eurowings.

398
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,146


399
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,120
The decision was made prior to the crash.

400
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,120


401
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,732
In the end Lufthansa compensated the families of the victims

402
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,732


403
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,741
but there are questions about whether it was enough.

404
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,741


405
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,011
The families have faced losses that no money can heal.

406
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,011


407
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,535
Hopefully you enjoyed this video, it was insanely hard to make.

408
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,535


409
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,332
We love animation and deep research

410
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,332


411
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:00,372
but it's expensive.

412
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:00,372


413
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,077
That's why we have sponsors on this channel.

414
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,077


415
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,116
By the way a lot of our animation in particular

416
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,116


417
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,670
actually has a lot to do with math,

418
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,670


419
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,340
be it geometry or linear algebra for specific shaders

420
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,340


421
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,669
or code for scripted and procedural animation.

422
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,669


423
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,436
Both can be exciting and fascinating

424
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,436


425
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,342
especially if taught in a playful manner.

426
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,342


427
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,625
That's where Brilliant comes in.

428
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,625


429
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,187
It gives you skills that can be applied to everything literally,

430
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,187


431
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:21,972
be it basic logic artificial intelligence data science or physics.

432
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:21,972


433
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,956
But it gives it to you in a way that isn't earth-shatteringly boring.

434
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,956


435
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:28,511
To try everything brilliant has to offer free for a full 30 days

442
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,707


443
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,843
even if it's only for a few minutes each day.

444
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,843


445
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,127
You can improve your skills while in a tram, walking

446
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,127


447
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,464
or while your significant other is trying to connect with you.

448
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,464


449
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:48,789
We personally love the app.

450
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:48,789


451
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,762
There's something incredibly satisfying

452
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,762


453
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,157
about really getting something

454
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,157


455
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:54,622
about solving puzzle or logic problem.

456
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:54,622


457
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:55,640
Why don't you give it a try.

458
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:55,640
